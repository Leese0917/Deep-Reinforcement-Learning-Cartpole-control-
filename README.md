# CS 4644 Fall 2023 - Comparing Deep Reinforcement Learning Techniques on Cartpole Control

## Summary
This project explores various deep reinforcement learning methods applied to the classic control problem of CartPole. The study compares different variants of Deep Q-Learning (DQN), including DQN, Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and CNN-based DQN, as well as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

Key components of the project include:

1. ``Method:``
2.
